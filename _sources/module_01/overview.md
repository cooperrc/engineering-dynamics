# Module 1 - Definitions and equations

In this module, we want to understand what makes objects move and how we
can describe motion. In previous physics courses, you might remember the
[kinematic
equations](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Map%3A_University_Physics_I_-_Mechanics_Sound_Oscillations_and_Waves_(OpenStax)/03%3A_Motion_Along_a_Straight_Line/3.07%3A_Free_Fall)
that describe the motion of a free-falling object.  How do these
equations relate to a ball rolling on the ground? or a domino falling
over? 

As an engineer, you will need to design objects that move or interact
with moving objects. You need quantitative descriptions for impacts,
forces, and work. This module will give you the tools to describe motion,
forces, work, and impact.
