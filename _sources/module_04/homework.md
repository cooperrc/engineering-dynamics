![falling ladder comparing the small angle to large
angle](./images/falling-ladder.svg)

The bar shown above is initially at $\theta = 0~rad$ when it begins to slide
away from the wall. Use conservation of energy and the constraints on
the motion of bar to find the angular velocity of the ladder when
$\theta=\frac{\pi}{6}~rad$. The bar is $m=0.5~kg$ and $L=1~m$-long.

![two masses attached to a rotating pendulum secured by
springs](./images/spring-pendulum.svg)

In the image above, 2 masses (A and B) are attached to each other by a
spring, $k = 1000~N/m$. Mass A ($m=1~kg$) is fixed to the end of a
rotating pendulum, $r_A = 1~m$. Mass B ($m=1~kg$) can bounce
up-and-down, but is always at the same angle as A, $\theta_A =
\theta_B$. The spring applies no force when B is at $r_B = 0.5~m$. 

1. define the kinetic energy of masses A and B in terms of
   $\dot{\theta}$, $\dot{r}_B$, and $r_B$
2. define the potential energy of masses A and B in terms of
   $\theta$ and $r_B$
3. If the system is released from rest at $\theta=90^o$ how far will
   mass B compress the spring as it swings through $\theta=0^o$?
