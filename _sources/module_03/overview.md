# Module 3 - Constrained engineering systems

_Pendulum motion_

1. Creating equations of motion
    1. draw a **Free body diagram**
    2. draw a **Kinetic diagram**
    3. use kinematic constraints to create the equations of motion for
       the system
2. Solving equations of motion
    1. Derive and define a set of linear differential equations e.g.
        - $\ddot{x} = -\omega^2 x$
        - $\ddot{x} = \lambda x$
        - $\ddot{x} = constant$
    2. Solve this set of linear differential equations
    3. Derive and define nonlinear differential equations
    4. Use computational methods to solve nonlinear differential
       equations
