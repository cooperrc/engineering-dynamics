### Course Description

Fundamentals of dynamics using vector methods. Rectilinear and
curvilinear motion, translation, rotation, plane motion; work, energy
and power; impulse and momentum. We will work through five course
modules:

- [Module_0 - Getting Started](module_00/overview.md)
- [Module_1 - Definitions and equations](module_01/overview.md)
- [Module_2 - constrained dynamic motion](module_02/overview.md)
- [Module_3 - constrained engineering systems](module_03/overview.md)
- [Module_4 - angular momentum in engineering](module_04/overview.md)
- [Module_5 - further applications in dynamics](module_05/overview.md)

### Course Objectives

Applied mechanics II is the study of objects in motion and their
interactions. It is the foundational knowledge for solid mechanics,
fluid mechanics, aerodynamic studies, control theory, systems and
mechanics, etc. Students are expected to use two disciplines to solve
problems:

1.  Apply **kinematics** to rigid body engineering problems, including:

    1.  Vector algebra

    2.  Vector calculus

    3.  Geometry.

2.  Appy **kinetics** to rigid body engineering problems, including:

    1.  The Newton-Euler equations: 
        > $\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}$ and
        > $M = \frac{d}{dt}h$

    2.  Conservation of energy:
        > $T_{1} + V_{1} + W_{1\rightarrow 2} = T_{2} + V_{2}$

    3.  Conservation of momentum: 
        > $\mathbf{F}dt = d(m\mathbf{v})$
        > and $\mathbf{M}dt = d\mathbf{h}$

3.  Apply kinematics and kinetics to solve a variety of engineering
    problems and use these disciplines to extend this work to problems
    in solid and fluid mechanics.

4.  Analyze, interpret, and communicate results from dynamic analysis.

5.  Create engineering design under constraints.

### Course Expectations

Students are expected to quantitatively describe the motion of objects
using calculus, Newton's laws of motion, energy, and momentum. Students
should be able to identify degrees of freedom and solve for the
position, velocity, and acceleration of rigid body objects based upon
applied forces.

This course will introduce analytical and numerical solutions to dynamic
interactions of objects. We will use Newton's laws of motion, calculus,
and algebra to derive differential equations of motion. We will use
Python to analyze and visualize dynamic problems.

In order to be successful in this course I expect:

-   You watch all media content provided
-   You do the assigned readings and provide discussion content
-   You go through derivations on your own
-   You turn in all assignments

### Applications

-   Automotive design: cam shafts, power requirements (both engine and
    brakes), windshield wipers, frame design, etc.
-   Aerospace design: turbine blades, power requirements, flight
    tracking, etc.
-   Biomechanics design: artificial knees/hips/..., sports physics,
    health/fitness tracking, etc.
-   Sports: ball-tracking, speedometers, helmet design, equipment design
    (baseball bat, lacrosse stick,...), etc.
-   ...

|**Item**  |       **Percent** |  **Requirement** |
|---|---|---|
|Participation|20 %|Discussions and peer review
|Homework| 30 %|Submit solutions on Google Classroom and revise based upon textbook solution
|Quizzes|30 %|5 quizzes

#### Note on Due dates

All the course due dates are included in the 
[*CE2120 - Fall Google
Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_classroom79539dba%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York)**.
Assignments should be submitted before 11:59pm on the due date.

*Due dates are flexible to account for
personal scheduling*. You do not need an excuse, but you
need to contact
[*ryan.c.cooper\@uconn.edu*](mailto:ryan.c.cooper@uconn.edu) to ask for
an extension. If you need help with the material, we can set up a
[meeting](https://cooperrc.github.io). If you just need more time, I'm happy to provide a
few extra days to get to an assignment done.

#### Note on Participation grade

The participation grade is based upon your own self assessment of how
you add to our learning community. You will fill out 2 forms:

1. Halfway: What is your current assessment? Why do you feel that way? I
   will help connect you to others if you don't feel engaged
2. Final: What is your final assessment? How did you participate? Ths
   is your final Participation grade.

You can add to the class in a number
of ways including, but not limited to:
- adding questions or answers to Campuswire discussions
- attending lectures
- participating in a study group or group chat
- sharing notes from lectures or videos


#### Note on Homeworks

All hand-written solutions need a legible scan. Android users should use
Google Drive's Scanning function:

[***Google Drive scanning support
(support.google.com)***](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3145835?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en&oco=0)

iOS users can use the following upload instructions:

Download
[***Scannable***](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote-scannable/id883338188?mt=8)
from the app store. Scan the document, press "send", press "share",
select "Google Drive", select "Upload".

[]{#anchor-16}Note on Quizzes

There will be six quizzes, one for each module. The quizzes are composed
of 2-4 questions based upon the readings and homeworks. You will scan
and upload your work to Google Classroom *along with a 10-30-second video
explaining your solution*.

#### Note on the Project Report

I want you to build a dynamics project that interests you.
Ideally, you can use this project in an engineering portfolio to
demonstrate your grasp of Newtonian mechanics. My goal is to help you
build this solution in a Jupyter notebook.

zone, please adjust your submittal times accordingly. The instructor
reserves the right to change dates accordingly as the semester
progresses. *All changes will be communicated via the calendar or
another appropriate notification.*

**Late Policy:** If you need more time for an assignment or experience
technical difficulties, reach out via Campuswire or email. The
instructor can make accommodations for work, family, and personal

and resources.*

### Feedback and Grades

I will make every effort to provide feedback and grades within 7 days.
To keep track of your performance in the course, refer to My Grades in
Google Classroom.

**Weekly Time Commitment**

You should expect to dedicate between 6 - 8 hours a week to this
course. This expectation is based on the various course activities,
assignments, and assessments and the University of Connecticut's policy
regarding credit hours. More information related to hours per week per
credit can be accessed at the [*Online Student
website*](https://onlinestudent.uconn.edu/learn-more/#collapsepanel-269-1-0-07).

This course requires *lots of practice*. You should set aside 6-8 hours
per week (assuming a 5-day work-week) to write out example problems from
the textbook, try homework problems, and revise answers. This is the
best way to prepare for quizzes.

identity in this course will include:

1.  Secure access to the learning management system using your unique
    UConn NetID and password.
2.  Students will submit videos to describe solutions to the 6 module
    quizzes.
