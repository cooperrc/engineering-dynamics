# Module 2 - constrained dynamic motion

_four-bar linkage and other moving systems_


1. Types of constraints and degrees of freedom
  1. pin joint
  2. sliding constraint
  3. rigid attachment
  4. Greubler count
2. Equations of motion with constraints
  1. count degrees of freedom choose variables
  2. define forces and kinematics with chosen variable
  3. solve for constrained equation of motion
3. Using smart coordinate systems 
  1. using mixed unit vectors
  1. radial and spherical
  2. rotating systems
