1. A flywheel is accelerated using two cords attached to the top and bottom of
the outer radii. Its acceleration when the forces are first applied is $\alpha
= -50~rad\hat{k}$. Where $\hat{k}$ points upwards out of the diagram. The moment of inertia is equal to $I = mr^2/2 = 100~kg
(0.1~m)^2/2 = 0.5~kg-m^2$. Use the Newton-Euler equations. What are the applied forces, $F$?

2. A mechanical sliding mechanism is designed for two arms to move the roller at
point C along the ground. A force $F=100~N$ is applied at the connecting link.
The long arm OA has length $l_1 = 50~mm$ and the short arm has length $l_2 =
42.43~mm$. A restoring force, $R$, is applied to prevent the system from accelerating

a. What angle, $\theta_1$, would the restoring force be $R=0$?

b. When the system is in the given configuration above, what is the restoring
force $R$?

3. Two four-bar linkage mechanisms are being compared for an engineering system.
Look at the geometry and motion videos and answer the questions about kinematic
motion for a given time.

$l_1 = 0.25~m,~l_2 = 1~m,~ l_3 = 1~m$

$dx = 1~m ~and~ dy = 0~m$

at time, $t$, link 1 (OA) is rotating at 10 rad/s. The positions of the pins
are as follows

$r_0 = 0\hat{i} + 0 \hat{j}$ [m]

$r_A = -0.203\hat{i}+0.1459\hat{j}$ [m]

$r_B = 0.494\hat{i} + 0.863\hat{j}$ [m]

$r_C = 1\hat{i} + 0\hat{j}$ [m]

What are the rotation rates for links 2 and 3 (AB and BC, respectively)

$l_1 = 0.25~m,~l_2 = 1~m,~ l_3 = 1~m$

$dx = 1~m ~and~ dy = -0.75~m$

at time, $t$, link 1 (OA) is rotating at 10 rad/s. The positions of the pins
are as follows

$r_0 = 0\hat{i} + 0 \hat{j}$ [m]

$r_A = 0\hat{i}+0.25\hat{j}$ [m]

$r_B = 0.968\hat{i} + 0.499\hat{j}$ [m]

$r_C = 1\hat{i} - 0.75\hat{j}$ [m]
